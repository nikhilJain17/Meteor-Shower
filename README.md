# Meteor Shower
My Android app shows a heatmap of meteorite strikes pulled from a NASA dataset. It plots the dataset and the exact points of impact on a map using the Google Maps API. It also pulls the user's current location, and returns a "danger report," or how many meteorites have struck within certain distances from the user. Additionally, it plots the location of NASA facilities in the US with their names so that the user can see how close meteorites have struck to NASA buildings.
